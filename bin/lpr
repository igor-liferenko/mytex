# This script is called by viewer (if viewer uses lpr for printing).
# It wraps the content to PJL and sends to printer directly.

# Pages to be printed must be selected from viewer (and hence by viewer).
# Algorithm for selection of pages is very simple,
# because in PS each page is separate. To ensure
# that pages selected by viewer are not changed during selection of pages,
# uncomment the following line and do diff of original file with
# /tmp/file.ps - the diff must show only non-selected pages.
#
# eval cp \${$#} /tmp/file.ps; exit
