Use this command to be sure that all PK-files for font xyz don't remain not updated:

    rm -f ~/tex/TeXfonts/*/xyz.*
    rm -f xyz.*pk # when you use the font via ./

(PK-files for the same font with different resolutions are totally independent from
each other, and therefore if a font is used in one document with different resolutions
and we regenerate one PK-file after changing MF source, it cannot be determined
automatically if another PK-file is out-of-date)

----------------------------------------------------------------

When a document uses font(s) via ./ use this command before running tex- after tex+ or
vice versa (i.e., before changing mf mode):

    ls | grep '\.[0-9]\+pk$' | xargs rm -f
